    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>
      This clear broth seasoned with soy sauce seems very simplistic, but it
      belies the intense umami flavor within the soup. We use chicken and 4
      types of dried seafood to create an incredibly savory broth that is
      seasoned with a soy sauce tare that gives the broth a bit of sweetness and
      wonderful complexity. The best thing about this recipe is that we use a
      pressure cooker that not only helps extract all the flavor very quickly
      but also creates a beautifully clear broth.

    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place chicken, scallops, anchovies, shrimp, bonito flakes, half the
          ginger, and kombu in an electric pressure cooker. Add water; close and
          lock the lid. Select the Soup setting; set timer for 90 minutes
          according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
          pressure to build.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
          manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through a
          colander or fine-mesh sieve. Skim the fatty oil off the top of the
          broth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, crack eggs into a large bowl and season with remaining 1/2
          teaspoon salt; whisk until well beaten. Add potato-onion mixture and
          toss to coat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, bonito flakes, sugar,
          garlic, and kombu in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a
          boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 10
          minutes. Strain tare sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 tablespoons of tare sauce into a large bowl. Ladle in about 2
        cups of broth. Add 1/6 of the ramen noodles. Repeat with remaining tare,
        broth, and ramen.
      </li>
