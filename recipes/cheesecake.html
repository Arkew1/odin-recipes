    </ul>

    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch
          springform pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar for crust in a
          bowl until mixture resembles wet sand. Transfer to the prepared pan.
          Use the bottom of a measuring cup to press crumbs firmly into an even
          layer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
          Remove from the oven and let sit on a wire rack until completely cool.
          Leave the oven on.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          While the crust is cooling, beat cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted
          with the paddle attachment on low speed until smooth.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Add sugar, sour cream, and vanilla. Scrape down the bottom and sides
          of the bowl and continue to beat until combined.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Gently whisk one egg with a fork in a small bowl; add to the cream
          cheese mixture and beat just until combined. Repeat with each
          remaining egg, whisking and adding just one at a time.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and firmly bang it on the counter
          a few times to release any large air bubbles.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Place the springform pan (with the cooled crust) in an oven bag. Fold
          down the excess and wrap the pan in a layer of heavy-duty aluminum
          foil. Pour cheesecake mixture into the pan.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan and move it to the
          lower rack of the oven.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Pour 2 inches of boiling water into the roasting pan. Bake cheesecake
          until edges are puffed and surface is firm except for a small spot in
          the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 ½
          hours. Tent the cheesecake with a sheet of foil if the top is browning
          too much during baking.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Turn off the oven; keep the oven door closed and let the cheesecake
          cool slowly for 2 hours.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Remove from the oven. Take the springform pan out of the water bath
          and set it on a cooling rack; let sit until it comes to room
          temperature, about 2 more hours. Place in the refrigerator until fully
          set, 8 hours to overnight.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the pan. Unhinge the lock
          and remove the pan sides. Use a warm, clean knife to cut every slice.
          Top slices with cherry pie filling. Keep leftovers in the
          refrigerator.
        </p>
